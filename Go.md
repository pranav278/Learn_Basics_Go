# Go intro
Go, also known as Golang, is a programming language developed by Google

## What is Go
- Statically typed, compiled language

- Designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google

- Built-in and semi-easy-to-use concurrency (Goroutines)

- Easy to compile and build executables/packages

## Why Go

- Designed for systems to be faster than C 

- Ended up being a great all-around language for systems, apps, and even automation

- It's like writing C in Python

- Go has it's own garbage collection and is more concise than C

- Strongly typed language


## What Is Written In Go

- Kubernetes

- Terraform

- Docker

- etcd

## Cross Platform

- WINDOWS

- MACOS

- LINUX (ALL FLAVORS)

## Go Is Not Object Oriented

- There aren't objects like in, for example, C#

- Go doesn't have an Object type (structs in Go aren't objects), Classes, or Inheritance (no classes, so no basing objects on other object)

- The closest thing you'll get to Objects in Go is a type/struct
